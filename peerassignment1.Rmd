Peer assesment 1 /Vilppu
========================================================

In this project the aim is to analyze some data and give answers to questions in order to learn the workflow of using knitr. I will be utilizing R, R-Studio, Knitr and Github to do so 

First I will download the data and check how it looks

```{r}
data<-read.csv("activity_data/activity.csv",header=TRUE,sep=",")

str(data)
```

In what follows I will first present the questions of the assignement and then answer to them 
and show the code which I have used for the analysis
